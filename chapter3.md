## Pendulum Time Period


*** =instructions
Jack happens to have a pendulum in his pocket, so he wants to measure the time needed for the pendulum to complete 1 period. Please create a function called timePeriod that takes in 2 parameters: an integer length and an integer height. Then, use the equation 2 * Ï€ * sqrt of length / gravitational force to return the value of the time period. Call the gForce function to find the gravitational force.
